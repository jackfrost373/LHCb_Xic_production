Repository for the LHCb analysis of the production ratio of Xic over Lc baryons, using the pKpi decay modes.

# Description
This repository is focussing on analysing a common decay mode of  two baryons pK- and pi+ over the full dataset provided by LHCb.
This project aims to measure the ratio of production between these two baryons to provide insight into the tendency of a charm-quark to group together with a down-quark rather than a strange-quark.
